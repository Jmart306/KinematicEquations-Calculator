# KinematicEquations-Calculator
It is based on the Kinematic Equations from AP Physics 1. This program will find you the final velocity, initial velocity, acceleration, or time in seconds if you input all the other values first. NOTE: It cannot find displacement but feature is planned.

To see the code select the KinematicEquationsCalc - Copy folder and then select the KinematicEquationsCalc folder AGAIN
and then select the KinematicEquationsCalc.cpp file to see the c++ code that makes up the app.
